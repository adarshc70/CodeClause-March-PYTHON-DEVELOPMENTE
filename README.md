# Task1_URL shortener
Description: In this code we have installed and imported an library function called pyshortners. This code defines a function called shorten_url() that takes a URL as input, creates a pyshorteners object, and uses the TinyURL provider to shorten the URL. The function returns the shortened URL.The code then prompts the user to enter a URL, calls the shorten_url() function to shorten the URL, and prints the shortened URL to the console.
Our main goal is to make large url as a short.
